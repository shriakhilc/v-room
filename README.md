# V-Room

## Overview

V-Room (Virtual Room) is a web application which aims to improve the virtual office hours experience in an educational setting.

There are three major functionalities in V-Room:

1. Students can see their position and total number of people in the queue while waiting to be let into the office hour meeting by the host.
2. Students have access to a question-answer portal in each course that they are enrolled in, which allows them to post questions, answer other questions and vote on questions and answers.
3. V-Room also helps students, professors and teaching assistants manage their courses by giving an opportunity to create courses, assign roles to members, invite students via link, and delete or archive courses.
